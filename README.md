Final Project

Hello! 
This is my final project for Dynamic Web Development class. The main goal of this project is to create awereness on misinformation by making reference to fake news.

Lots of things you read online especially in your social media feeds may appear to be true, often is not.
Traditionally we got our news from trusted sources, journalists and media outlets that are required to follow strict codes of practice. 
However, the internet has enabled a whole new way to publish, share and consume information and news with very little regulation or editorial standards.

My project is a fake news web application that all the news are created by RunwayMLâ€™s machine learning tools. 
The content of news are trained by text-based generative models from real news text files and the images of each news generated by models like StyleGAN2, SpadeCOCO, BigGAN, Few Shot Face Translation GAN and so on.

This project is built on ;
-Node.js 
-Express.js
-Glitch, github and MongoDB Atlas for database hosting 

Languages:
HTML CSS and JavaScript 

Nothing on this project is real! All images and texts are created with machine learning tools.
